Actively limiting blue light, both artificial and natural, can make you a healthier and happier person. No, really, it can. Imagine a workday without eye strain or grogginess and control over your ability to fall asleep comfortably. With some tweaks to daily habits and a blue light filter this can be a reality.

## What is Blue Light?

## On Eye Strain

Sitting for 8+ hours staring at a screen isn't what you're paid for - you're paid to produce results and you can only do that if you're healthy. Eye strain leads to headaches and health problems as your eyes get worse over time.

Get up. Move around. Take a break from the computer screen. Talk with your coworkers. Avoid eating lunch at your desk. While we're reducing our blue, let's up our green - go outside and see some grass, trees, plants to feel refreshed and revitalized. Some time in the sun can help too.

## On Sleep

Blue light activates "wake up" signals in our brain (what? this isn't a science blog). Avoid these wake up signals 30-60 minutes before bed and you'll not only fall asleep more easily, but you'll be awaken more smoothly without that groggy sensation.

If you're unable to get 30-60 minutes away from a screen before bed then reconsider your nighttime habits. Worse yet, if you're coding late into the night then immediately attempt going to sleep your mind is at its most active state or you could burn yourself out.

Quality of sleep is far more important than the quantity of sleep you receive. If you're not waking up feeling refreshed then you'll need to reconsider your sleep habits. For bonus points, cut out caffeine from your diet some or entirely.
