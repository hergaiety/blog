# Woking Title - How Driving Open Source at Work Made Me a Better Developer

Connecting with the open source community has lead to more passionate work with like-minded people while transforming the way I develop. Listening for available opportunities and creating new ones where they could exist is the essence of taking an active role in driving your career.

**Open source in the workplace** isn't particularly common, but it is rewarding for everyone involved. Likely you'll need to [sell the benefits to the company](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2486991/app-development-4-reasons-companies-say-yes-to-open-source.html) like a sales pitch (if you're reading this, I don't need to sell you on the benefits of open source). It's equally important to anticipate concerns the company may have such as new workflows (Github rather than Gitlab/Bitbucket) and red tape (policies and a code of conduct).

Ditch the fear. Open yourself to collaboration with colleagues and beyond. I cannot express how much better I feel after changing my mindset from that of a thinker to that of a doer. No longer must perfection be the enemy.

Challenges:

* Who does this benefit?
* Permission needed?
* New workflow to contribute (Github, not BitBucket)
* Policies and Red Tape

Pros:

* Fewer tests and less code. Separation of concerns.
* Community contributions.
* Stronger by forced isolation. (Edge cases sneaking in)

What I Learned:

* How to write, publish, then consume an Ember addon.
* Asking other teams to collaborate with me to get the job done, lead me to joining a new team that I love.
